## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- A GPU with WebGPU support (Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 12)

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
cargo run --release
```

**Note:** This application requires a display/window system to run. On Linux, ensure you have either X11 or Wayland available. On headless systems, the application won't run as it requires GPU rendering capabilities.

### Examples

```

This example demonstrates:
- Creating a compute shader that processes particle data (position, velocity updates)
- Creating a render pipeline that visualizes the computed particles as colored points
- Sharing a buffer between compute and render pipelines using STORAGE + VERTEX usage flags
- Multiple frames showing the compute shader updating particle positions
- Simple particle physics with boundary collision and circular motion

**Example output:**
```
=== Compute-Render Buffer Sharing Example ===

Using adapter: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080
Backend: Vulkan

Created 1024 particles arranged in a circle
  - Each particle has position, velocity, and color
  - Particles will be updated by compute shader
  - Same buffer will be used for vertex data in render pass

✓ Created shared buffer with STORAGE + VERTEX usage
  - Size: 32768 bytes (1024 particles)
  - STORAGE flag: allows compute shader access
  - VERTEX flag: allows render pipeline access

Setting up compute pipeline...
✓ Compute pipeline created
  - Updates particle positions based on velocity
  - Applies boundary collision detection
  - Adds circular motion effect

Setting up render pipeline...
✓ Render pipeline created
  - Draws particles as points (PointList topology)
  - Uses particle position and color from buffer
  - Alpha blending enabled for nice visual effect

Executing compute and render operations...

Frame 0:
  ✓ Compute pass: Updated particle positions
  ✓ Render pass: Drew 1024 particles as points
  ✓ Commands submitted and completed

Frame 1:
  ✓ Compute pass: Updated particle positions
  ✓ Render pass: Drew 1024 particles as points
  ✓ Commands submitted and completed

Frame 2:
  ✓ Compute pass: Updated particle positions
  ✓ Render pass: Drew 1024 particles as points
  ✓ Commands submitted and completed

  ✓ Compute shader that processes particle data
  ✓ Render pipeline that visualizes the same data
  ✓ Buffer sharing between compute and render pipelines
  ✓ Multiple frames showing data updates from compute shader

Key Concepts:
  • STORAGE usage: Enables read/write access in compute shaders
  • VERTEX usage: Enables use as vertex buffer in render pipeline
  • Combined usage allows seamless data flow from compute to render
  • Same buffer used without copying, maximizing GPU efficiency

### WebGPU Implementation

The playground supports different WebGPU implementations:

- **wgpu** (default): Pure Rust implementation used by Firefox
  - Fast, safe, and cross-platform
  - Actively maintained by the gfx-rs team
  - Production-ready with full WebGPU support
  - https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu

- **Dawn** (native + fallback): C++ implementation used by Chromium
  - Google's reference implementation
  - Attempts to build actual Dawn C++ library from source
  - Falls back to wgpu-core when Dawn build unavailable
  - Cross-platform support (Windows D3D12, Linux Vulkan, macOS Metal)
  - **Status**: Native FFI when built, wgpu-core fallback otherwise
  - https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn

#### Selecting Implementation

By default, the application uses the **wgpu** implementation. You can select the implementation in two ways:

**1. Compile-time (feature flags):**
```bash
# Default: wgpu implementation
cargo build --release

# Enable Dawn (builds from source, requires CMake)
cargo build --release --features dawn
```

**First Dawn build requirements:**
- Git (to clone Dawn repository)
- CMake 3.16+ (to build Dawn)
- C++ compiler with C++20 support
- Python 3 (for Dawn's dependency scripts)
- Build time: 10-30 minutes (first build only)
- **Note**: If build fails, automatically falls back to wgpu-core

**Install build tools:**
If you want to use actual Dawn C++ library (optional), install:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential python3 libvulkan-dev

# macOS (Homebrew):
brew install git cmake python3

# Windows:
# Install Visual Studio with C++ support, CMake, Git, Python 3
```

**Note**: If build tools are not available, the `dawn` feature will automatically use wgpu-core as a compatible fallback. See [docs/BUILDING_DAWN.md](docs/BUILDING_DAWN.md) for details.

**2. Runtime (environment variable):**
```bash
# Use wgpu implementation (default)
WEBGPU_IMPL=wgpu cargo run --release

# Use Dawn implementation (requires --features dawn)
WEBGPU_IMPL=dawn cargo run --release --features dawn
```

The active WebGPU implementation and its status is displayed in the **Device Info** and **Adapter Selection** tabs.

### Backend Selection

Within a WebGPU implementation, you can select which graphics API backend to use via the `WGPU_BACKEND` environment variable:

```bash
# Use Vulkan backend
WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan cargo run --release

# Use Metal backend (macOS/iOS)
WGPU_BACKEND=metal cargo run --release

# Use DirectX 12 backend (Windows)
WGPU_BACKEND=dx12 cargo run --release

# Use OpenGL backend
WGPU_BACKEND=gl cargo run --release

# Use primary backends (default for platform)
WGPU_BACKEND=primary cargo run --release

# Use all available backends (default if not specified)
WGPU_BACKEND=all cargo run --release
```

**Available Backend Options:**
- `vulkan` or `vk` - Vulkan API (Windows, Linux, Android, macOS via MoltenVK)
- `metal` or `mtl` - Metal API (macOS, iOS)
- `dx12`, `d3d12`, or `directx12` - DirectX 12 API (Windows 10+)
- `gl` or `opengl` - OpenGL/OpenGL ES API
- `primary` - Platform's primary backends (Vulkan, Metal, DX12, Browser WebGPU)
- `all` - All available backends (default)

The active backend is displayed prominently in the **Device Info** tab of the application.

## Troubleshooting

### DirectX 12 Resource State Errors on AMD GPUs (Windows)

If you see console error messages like:

```
[ERROR wgpu_hal::auxil::dxgi::exception] ID3D12CommandQueue1::ExecuteCommandLists: 
Resource state (0x4: D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RENDER_TARGET) of resource is invalid for use as a PRESENT_SOURCE.
Expected State Bits (all): 0x0: D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_[COMMON|PRESENT]
INVALID_SUBRESOURCE_STATE
```

This is a known issue with the wgpu DirectX 12 backend on AMD GPUs (and occasionally other GPUs). These errors are validation warnings from the DirectX 12 debug layer (typically seen when running debug builds or with GPU validation enabled) and do not affect visual rendering in most cases. They occur due to missing or incorrect resource state transitions in the wgpu-hal DirectX 12 backend.

**Note:** These errors may not appear in release builds without debug layers, but are common during development.

**Solution: Use the Vulkan Backend**

The most effective workaround is to use the Vulkan backend instead of DirectX 12:

```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
set WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan
cargo run --release

# Windows PowerShell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND="vulkan"
cargo run --release

# Or run directly
WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan cargo run --release
```

The application will automatically prefer the Vulkan backend on Windows when no explicit backend is specified, but you can force DirectX 12 with `WGPU_BACKEND=dx12` if needed.

**Note:** This issue is being tracked upstream in the wgpu project. The errors are cosmetic and typically don't cause rendering issues, but they can spam the console log. Using Vulkan avoids the issue entirely.
