## Overview

This is an interactive tool for experimenting with the wgpu crate's WebGPU API capabilities. It provides a graphical user interface built with egui that allows you to explore and test various WebGPU features including rendering pipelines, compute shaders, and ML inferencing operations.

## Features

- **GPU Adapter Selection**: Choose from available GPU adapters with detailed properties and configure power preferences
- **Device Information**: View detailed information about your GPU, including adapter info, device limits, and supported features
- **Device Configuration**: Configure device features and limits before device creation
- **Buffer Configuration**: Create and configure GPU buffers with custom parameters including size, usage flags, and mapping options
- **Rendering APIs**: Experiment with render pipelines, shaders, buffers, textures, and advanced rendering techniques
- **Compute/ML APIs**: Test compute pipelines, storage buffers, and machine learning operations
- **Code Export**: Generate standalone Rust projects from your playground configuration with one click
- **State Persistence**: Save and load your playground configurations to/from JSON files
- **URL Sharing**: Generate shareable links with your configuration encoded in the URL for easy collaboration

**📊 For a comprehensive overview of WebGPU API feature coverage, see [WebGPU API Coverage](docs/WEBGPU_API_COVERAGE.md)**

## Sharing and Collaboration

The playground supports multiple ways to save and share your work:

### Save/Load State

Use the file operations in the top menu bar to save and load playground configurations:

- **💾 Save State**: Save your current configuration to a JSON file
- **📂 Load State**: Load a previously saved configuration from a JSON file

Saved configurations include:
- Buffer settings (size, usage flags, labels)
- Texture settings (dimensions, format, usage)
- Sampler settings (filtering, addressing modes)
- Shader source code and labels

### URL Sharing

Generate shareable links that encode your entire playground state:

1. Configure your resources (buffers, textures, shaders, etc.)
2. Click **🔗 Generate Share Link** in the top menu bar
3. The link is automatically copied to your clipboard
4. Share the URL with others - they can open it to see your exact configuration

**Example share URL format:**
```
https://telecos.github.io/wgpu_playground/demo?state=eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoiMS4wIi...
```

When someone opens a share URL, the playground automatically loads the encoded state and restores all your settings.

**Note**: URL sharing works best for reasonably-sized configurations. Very large shader code or many resources may result in long URLs.

### WebGPU Implementation

The playground supports different WebGPU implementations:

- **wgpu** (default): Pure Rust implementation used by Firefox
  - Fast, safe, and cross-platform
  - Actively maintained by the gfx-rs team
  - Production-ready with full WebGPU support
  - https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu

- **Dawn** (native + fallback): C++ implementation used by Chromium
  - Google's reference implementation
  - Attempts to build actual Dawn C++ library from source
  - Falls back to wgpu-core when Dawn build unavailable
  - Cross-platform support (Windows D3D12, Linux Vulkan, macOS Metal)
  - **Status**: Native FFI when built, wgpu-core fallback otherwise
  - https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn

#### Selecting Implementation

By default, the application uses the **wgpu** implementation. You can select the implementation in two ways:

**1. Compile-time (feature flags):**
```bash
# Default: wgpu implementation
cargo build --release

# Enable Dawn (builds from source, requires CMake)
cargo build --release --features dawn
```

**First Dawn build requirements:**
- Git (to clone Dawn repository)
- CMake 3.16+ (to build Dawn)
- C++ compiler with C++20 support
- Python 3 (for Dawn's dependency scripts)
- Build time: 10-30 minutes (first build only)
- **Note**: If build fails, automatically falls back to wgpu-core

**Install build tools:**
If you want to use actual Dawn C++ library (optional), install:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential python3 libvulkan-dev

# macOS (Homebrew):
brew install git cmake python3

# Windows:
# Install Visual Studio with C++ support, CMake, Git, Python 3
```

**Note**: If build tools are not available, the `dawn` feature will automatically use wgpu-core as a compatible fallback. See [docs/BUILDING_DAWN.md](docs/BUILDING_DAWN.md) for details.

**2. Runtime (environment variable):**
```bash
# Use wgpu implementation (default)
WEBGPU_IMPL=wgpu cargo run --release

# Use Dawn implementation (requires --features dawn)
WEBGPU_IMPL=dawn cargo run --release --features dawn
```

The active WebGPU implementation and its status is displayed in the **Device Info** and **Adapter Selection** tabs.

### Backend Selection

Within a WebGPU implementation, you can select which graphics API backend to use via the `WGPU_BACKEND` environment variable:

```bash
# Use Vulkan backend
WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan cargo run --release

# Use Metal backend (macOS/iOS)
WGPU_BACKEND=metal cargo run --release

# Use DirectX 12 backend (Windows)
WGPU_BACKEND=dx12 cargo run --release

# Use OpenGL backend
WGPU_BACKEND=gl cargo run --release

# Use primary backends (default for platform)
WGPU_BACKEND=primary cargo run --release

# Use all available backends (default if not specified)
WGPU_BACKEND=all cargo run --release
```

**Available Backend Options:**
- `vulkan` or `vk` - Vulkan API (Windows, Linux, Android, macOS via MoltenVK)
- `metal` or `mtl` - Metal API (macOS, iOS)
- `dx12`, `d3d12`, or `directx12` - DirectX 12 API (Windows 10+)
- `gl` or `opengl` - OpenGL/OpenGL ES API
- `primary` - Platform's primary backends (Vulkan, Metal, DX12, Browser WebGPU)
- `all` - All available backends (default)

The active backend is displayed prominently in the **Device Info** tab of the application.

## Troubleshooting

### DirectX 12 Resource State Errors on AMD GPUs (Windows)

If you see console error messages like:

```
[ERROR wgpu_hal::auxil::dxgi::exception] ID3D12CommandQueue1::ExecuteCommandLists: 
Resource state (0x4: D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_RENDER_TARGET) of resource is invalid for use as a PRESENT_SOURCE.
Expected State Bits (all): 0x0: D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_[COMMON|PRESENT]
INVALID_SUBRESOURCE_STATE
```

This is a known issue with the wgpu DirectX 12 backend on AMD GPUs (and occasionally other GPUs). These errors are validation warnings from the DirectX 12 debug layer (typically seen when running debug builds or with GPU validation enabled) and do not affect visual rendering in most cases. They occur due to missing or incorrect resource state transitions in the wgpu-hal DirectX 12 backend.

**Note:** These errors may not appear in release builds without debug layers, but are common during development.

**Solution: Use the Vulkan Backend**

The most effective workaround is to use the Vulkan backend instead of DirectX 12:

```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
set WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan
cargo run --release

# Windows PowerShell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND="vulkan"
cargo run --release

# Or run directly
WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan cargo run --release
```

The application will automatically prefer the Vulkan backend on Windows when no explicit backend is specified, but you can force DirectX 12 with `WGPU_BACKEND=dx12` if needed.

**Note:** This issue is being tracked upstream in the wgpu project. The errors are cosmetic and typically don't cause rendering issues, but they can spam the console log. Using Vulkan avoids the issue entirely.

## Testing

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive unit and integration tests that run in both local and CI environments:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run tests for a specific package
cargo test --package wgpu_playground_core

# Run a specific test
cargo test --package wgpu_playground_core --test buffer_integration_test
```

### Headless GPU Testing

Tests automatically detect headless/CI environments (via `CI` or `WGPU_HEADLESS` environment variables) and use software rendering adapters to enable GPU testing without physical hardware:

- **Local Testing**: Tests use available hardware GPU adapters
- **CI/Headless**: Tests automatically switch to software rendering (Vulkan lavapipe or OpenGL)
- **Fallback Adapter**: In headless mode, `force_fallback_adapter` is enabled for software rendering

**Manually enable headless mode:**

```bash
# Set WGPU_HEADLESS to force software rendering
WGPU_HEADLESS=1 cargo test --workspace

# Or set CI variable
CI=1 cargo test --workspace
```

### Visual Regression Testing

This project includes a visual regression testing framework to catch unintended visual changes in GPU rendering output. The framework:

- Captures rendered GPU textures to PNG images
- Compares captured output with reference images
- Generates diff images highlighting discrepancies
- Supports configurable comparison thresholds

**Running Visual Regression Tests:**

```bash
# Run all visual regression tests
cargo test --package wgpu_playground_core visual_regression

# Generate or update reference images (do this on a system with GPU)
UPDATE_VISUAL_REFERENCES=1 cargo test --package wgpu_playground_core visual_regression
```

**Note:** Visual regression tests work in both local and headless/CI environments thanks to automatic software rendering adapter selection.

For detailed information about the visual regression framework, see [tests/visual_regression/reference/README.md](tests/visual_regression/reference/README.md).
